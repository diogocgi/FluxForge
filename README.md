Forge your Image Datasets and Flux Loras easily with fully containerized tools and guides. 
> üéâ Let's make model training easily accessible! üéâ


## Introduction

With the release of [Flux1.0](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux) by **Black Forest Labs** I regained my interest with image generation and started exploring how to train Lora's for Flux.

From my research, there is a lot of information in the web regarding dataset generation and training for Flux and other image generation models, but it is scatttered throughout numerous Reddit posts, GitHub issues, websites, etc.

Setting up the development environment is also a hassle, even more so for people without much programming knowledge, which may lead to many giving up before even starting.

To tackle both these issues, I created this repository to serve as a spot for enabling people to easely deploy containarized tools and guides for various Machine Learning related tasks.

My goal is to help 1 other person at the very least! üòÜ
